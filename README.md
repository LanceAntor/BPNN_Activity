# **Backpropagation Activity**

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network trained via backpropagation to simulate a 4-input AND gate.

---

## **Training Details**

- **Training Dataset**:  
  Includes all 16 possible combinations for a 4-input AND gate, where the output is `1` only when all inputs are `1`.

- **Hidden Layers**:  
  A minimum of **100 neurons** in the hidden layer is required for the network to effectively learn the pattern.

- **Epochs**:  
  The network must undergo at least **1000 training iterations** for proper convergence.

- **Output**:  
  A single neuron in the output layer is used to represent the result of the AND gate (`0` or `1`).
